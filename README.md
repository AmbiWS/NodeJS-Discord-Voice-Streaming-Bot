The main difference from music bot is feature to reading lectures from your schedule.  
You're able to set time when 'ProfessorBot' will come.  
You can manage schedule as you wish, one discipline can contain multiple lectures or videos.  
Also there is breaks with classical music between disciplines.  
ProfessorBot notify every event: begin, next discipline, break, etc...  
Little feature is that bot parsing /science subreddit and message you on new post.  
If you're not interested in lectures thats fine, ProfessorBot can perform as music-bot with queue to play.
